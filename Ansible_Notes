🛠️ What is Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used to manage IT infrastructure.
Think of it as your command center for deploying apps, configuring systems, and orchestrating complex workflows across multiple machines.

🚀 What Ansible Does?

-Configuration Management: Set up servers with specific settings (e.g., install packages, configure services).
-Application Deployment: Push code and updates across environments.
-Infrastructure Provisioning: Create and manage cloud resources (VMs, networks, etc.).
-Orchestration: Coordinate tasks across multiple systems in a defined order.

🔧 Key Features-

-Agentless: No need to install anything on target machines—it uses SSH or WinRM.
-Written in Python: Easy to extend and integrate with other tools.
-Uses YAML Playbooks: Human-readable scripts that define tasks and configurations.
-Idempotent Modules: Ensures tasks only make changes when needed—no duplication or errors.

🧠 Core Concepts-

-Term:	Meaning

-Control Node:	The machine where you run Ansible commands.
-Managed Nodes:	The systems you’re automating (servers, devices, etc.)
-Inventory:	A list of managed nodes, grouped for easier targeting.
-Modules:	Reusable units of work (e.g., install a package, copy a file).
-Tasks:	Individual actions performed by modules.
-Playbooks:	Ordered sets of tasks written in YAML.

🖥️ Example Playbook Snippet-

yaml
/////*****
- hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
*****/////

This would install Apache on all servers in the webservers group.
